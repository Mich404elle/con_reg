Figure No. 1

Typical tactile guide path junction.

The figure shows the three kinds of tactile tiles or blocks commonly used in constructing a tactile guide path. Directional tile or block has parallel raised bars for guiding the users along an intended safe path. Hazard warning tile or block has raised big dots (35 mm in diameter) arranged in square grid parallel to the sides of the slab for indication of potential

hazards ahead. This type of tile or block can be used alone to form tactile warning strips at the top and bottom ends of staircase or ramps, and at dropped kerb. Positional tile or block has raised small dots (23 mm in diameter) placed in staggered positions for indication of possible change in walking directions.
